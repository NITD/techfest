                We, at NIT Delhi, aim to bring about the betterment in society by creating
                positive change - however small or big the change may be. Keeping this in mind,
                the Social Reformation Cell of NIT Delhi has taken an initiative - UDAAN,
                which started on the 20th December, 2016.
            </p>
            <p class="space-para">
                Under UDAAN, we help to provide education to children who would otherwise be
                unable to pay for school fees and are also currently living in slums.
            </p>
            <p class="space-para">
                As concerned citizens, we need to do something about this issue; something
                meaningful, something concrete and something urgently. Because as a society,
                we must realize that children are the future of our country and education
                is the key to success.
